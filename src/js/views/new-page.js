                      Big pages sync slower. To make sure your ledger is updated
                      and loaded as fast as possible, it is a good idea to
                      create a new page once in a while. The process is
                      following:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          A new page seed is generated and attached to your
                          ledger.
                        </li>
                        <li>A new address is generated on the new page.</li>
                        <li>
                          The balance from the oldest page (if any) is
                          transferred to the new page's address.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                      The whole process should not take more than a few minutes.
                      The old balance should be available to spend on the new
                      page within 5-10 minutes (as soon as the transaction is
                      confirmed).
